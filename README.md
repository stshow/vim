# My VIM config repo. 

Will add scripts for provisioning VIM etc etc.

1. provision-vim.sh

This script backs up your current config and then pulls in the excellent configs from https://hobo.house/2016/04/09/trick-out-your-vim-editor/. 

##### The plan is to fork this eventually with my own preferred modifications. For now, the only modification I make is to set textwidth to 0.
